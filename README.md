Description:
    This is my first web project, created with the help of my basic knowledge and a little bit of Artificial Intelligence.
    Itâ€™s a simple clothing website with a clean and responsive design.
    The website structure is very simple, and I have used white, orange, and black colors to keep it minimal and attractive.

Technologies Used:
    HTML

    CSS

    Basic JavaScript

    A little bit of AI assistance

Features:
    Simple and clean layout

    Easy to navigate

    Modern color theme (White, Orange, Black)

    Responsive design

Purpose:
    This project was created for learning and practice purposes, and it helped me understand how to design and structure a basic website.

Note:
    Iâ€™m still learning and improving my skills â€” feedback and suggestions are always welcome! ðŸ˜Š
